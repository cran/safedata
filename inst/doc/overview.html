<p>The <code>safedata</code> R package is designed to discover and work with data using the formatting and
indexing API designed for the Stability of Altered Forest Ecosystems (SAFE) Project. The <a href="https://www.safeproject.net/">SAFE
Project</a> is one the largest ecological experiments in the world,
investigating the effects of human activities on biodiversity and ecosystem function in the
Malaysian rainforest.</p>

<p>Research conducted at the SAFE Project encompasses expertise from many 
disciplines and institutions, each running interlinked projects that help to 
develop our understanding of ecology within changing environments. Data from 
the many activities conducted through the SAFE Project are curated and published to 
a community repository hosted at  <a href="https://zenodo.org/communities/safe/">Zenodo</a>.The
<code>safedata</code> package enables researchers to quickly and easily interface with 
these datasets. </p>

<h1>The SAFE Project dataset workflow</h1>

<p>All researchers working at the SAFE Project are required to submit their project
data to the <a href="https://zenodo.org/communities/safe/">SAFE Zenodo repository</a>. There 
are the following 3 stages to the publication process, with further details provided below.</p>

<ol>
<li>The data needs to be <strong>formatted</strong> to meet a community standard and to include
core metadata required by the project.</li>
<li>The data is <strong>validated</strong> to ensure that the formatting and metadata comply with
the required standard.</li>
<li>Data that passes validation is <strong>published</strong> to the Zenodo data repository.</li>
<li>Metadata is indexed at the SAFE Project website and is accessible through a search API.</li>
</ol>

<h2>Data format</h2>

<p>Datasets are submitted as Microsoft Excel spreadsheets, containing the following
worksheets:</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Summary</strong>: simple metadata (authors, access rights) about the dataset</li>
<li><strong>Taxa</strong>: a description of the Taxa reported in the dataset</li>
<li><strong>Locations</strong>: a description of all sampling locations in the dataset</li>
<li><strong>Data worksheets</strong>: the actual data tables, described in the <strong>Summary</strong> sheet</li>
</ul>

<p>The formatting details for each worksheet are described here: <a href="https://safedata-validator.readthedocs.io/en/latest/data_format/overview.html">https://safedata-validator.readthedocs.io/en/latest/data_format/overview.html</a></p>

<p>Once a dataset has been formatted, researchers can submit the dataset to
the SAFE Project website for validation and publication.</p>

<h2>Dataset validation</h2>

<p>Submitted datasets are validated using the Python program  (<code>safedata_validator</code>)[<a href="https://github.com/ImperialCollegeLondon/safedata_validator">https://github.com/ImperialCollegeLondon/safedata_validator</a>]. 
This checks that the dataset format is correct and that all the required metadata is 
provided and consistent. When a dataset fails validation, a report is returned to
the submitter to help revise the dataset, otherwise validated datasets are published
to Zenodo.</p>

<h2>Data publication</h2>

<p><a href="https://zenodo.org">Zenodo</a> is a scientific data repository backed by the CERN. Zenodo 
provides data <strong>communities</strong> that allow all of the SAFE Project datasets to be collated
into a single collection ((<a href="https://zenodo.org/communities/safe/">https://zenodo.org/communities/safe/</a>). The publication process
uses the metadata provided in the submitted file to automatically create a detailed 
description of the dataset. Zenodo also issues DOIs for published datasets and provides 
versioning and access control :</p>

<h3>Data versioning</h3>

<p>Zenodo uses a <a href="https://help.zenodo.org/">DOI versioning</a> system that allows sets
of dataset records to be grouped. When a dataset is published on Zenodo for the
first time, two DOIs are registered:</p>

<ul>
<li>the <strong>record</strong>  DOI, representing the specific version of the dataset, and</li>
<li>the <strong>concept</strong> DOI,  representing all versions of the record.</li>
</ul>

<p>Subsequent versions of an upload are then logged under a new DOI. This means
that multiple versions of a dataset can be stored and referenced clearly. The concept DOI
refers to all versions of the dataset (and the DOI link resolves to the most recent version),
while the version DOI refers to a particular instance.</p>

<h3>Dataset access</h3>

<p>Datasets published to the SAFE Project community on Zenodo can have one of the following 
three access status:</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Open</strong>: the dataset is open for download, or</li>
<li><strong>Embargoed</strong>: the dataset will become open at a given date in the future, or</li>
<li><strong>Restricted</strong>: accessing the dataset requires permission. Zenodo provides a mechanism to request permission from the SAFE Project, which will always be passed onto the specific dataset authors. </li>
</ul>

<p>In practice, restricted data is little used and a fourth &#39;Closed&#39; status is not accepted for SAFE 
datasets. Note that a particular dataset concept may have a versions with a mixture of access
statuses.</p>

<h2>Dataset discovery and indexing</h2>

<p>The Zenodo website provides the ability to search the text of record descriptions, including a search
tool specifically for the <a href="https://www.zenodo.org/communities/safe/search">SAFE Project community</a>.
However, these searches are unstructured and do not cover all of the metadata contained within
published datasets. The SAFE Project website therefore maintains a <a href="https://www.safeproject.net/api">search API</a> that allows 
structured queries to be performed on the following:</p>

<ul>
<li><strong><code>dates</code></strong>: the start and endpoints of data collection within a dataset, </li>
<li><strong><code>fields</code></strong>: the text and field type of fields within indidual data tables within a dataset,</li>
<li><strong><code>authors</code></strong>: the authors of datasets,</li>
<li><strong><code>text</code></strong>: a free text search of dataset, worksheet and field titles and descriptions.</li>
<li><strong><code>taxa</code></strong>: the taxa included  in a dataset, and</li>
<li><strong><code>spatial</code></strong>: matching datasets by sampling location.</li>
</ul>

<p>In addition, the API provides a <strong><code>record</code></strong> endpoint that allows the full record metadata to be downloaded in JSON format.</p>

<h1>SAFE data directories</h1>

<p>The <code>safedata</code> package stores downloaded datasets, record metadata and key index
files within a data directory, which is used as a local repository of the datasets used by
an individual researcher. The structure of the directory is critical to the operation of the
package and the datasets themselves are under version control: users <strong>must not change</strong>
the structure or the file contents of this directory.</p>

<p>The directory structure is as follows: three index files are stored in the root of the directory, 
which will also contain a folder named with the <strong>concept</strong> id number of each dataset
that has been downloaded. These concept folders will then contain at least one subfolder
giving named with the <strong>record</strong> number of a downloaded dataset. These subfolders
will then contain the record files downloaded from Zenodo and a JSON format file containing
the dataset metadata. The directory also contains a JSON format file that that records the base URL of the dataset index website.</p>

<p>For example:</p>

<pre><code>gazetteer.geojson
index.json
location_aliases.csv
url.json
1400561/1400562/1400562.json
1400561/1400562/Psomas_Ant_Pselaphine_SAFE_dataset.xlsx
</code></pre>
